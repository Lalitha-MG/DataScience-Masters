    "Value range: Although both correlation coefficient and covariance are measures of linear association, correlation coefficients are standardized, therefore displaying an absolute value within a definite range from -1 to 1. On the other hand, covariance values are not standardized and use an indefinite range from -âˆž to +âˆž , which makes the interpretation of covariance a bit tricky.\n",
